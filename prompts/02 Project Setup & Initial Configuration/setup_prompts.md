## A.
Start creating the task (Project Setup & Initial Configuration) mentioned in #file:prompts\TASK.md. If the task is already completed that is marked with [x] then no need to proceed, just focus on the task that are not completed.

For example:
- [x] Task A
- [ ] Task B

In this case, directly proceed to Task B since Task A is already completed.
