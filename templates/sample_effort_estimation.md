# ðŸ§® Man-Day Estimation Guideline (Web Application Development)

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose

This document outlines standardized guidelines for estimating **man-day effort** for all phases of **web application development**. It is designed for software engineers, tech leads, project managers, and LLM-powered assistants to produce **realistic, granular estimates** for project planning, sprint sizing, and capacity forecasting.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Scope

* Web-based systems (Single Page Applications, REST APIs, Admin Panels)
* Common tech stacks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Django, Laravel)
* Agile-based delivery environments (2-week sprints, CI/CD pipelines)
* Estimation includes: **design, development, testing, review, and deployment**

## ðŸ”¹ Estimation Philosophy

| Principle              | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 man-day**          | 8 productive work hours (excluding meetings, context switching)      |
| **Granularity**        | Decompose stories into **atomic, independently estimable** tasks     |
| **Include All Phases** | Account for coding, testing, reviews, rework, and deployment         |
| **Assume Ideal Dev**   | Mid-level engineer familiar with the stack and domain                |
| **Define Assumptions** | Every estimate must state environment, dependencies, and constraints |
| **Apply Buffer**       | Add 10â€“20% buffer depending on risk, complexity, and unknowns        |

## ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

* Always **log assumptions** explicitly.
* Use **relative sizing** with Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8) when exact hours arenâ€™t feasible.
* Reference **historical estimates** and adjust based on outcome deltas.
* For sprints, avoid tasks exceeding **3 man-days** â€“ break them down.
* Do **dry-runs of estimates** with engineers and PMs.
